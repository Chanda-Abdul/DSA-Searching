## 3. Find a book

Imagine you are looking for a book in a library with a Dewey Decimal index. How would you go about it? Can you express this process as a search algorithm? 

````
function dewDecSearch(dew, title, start, end) {
  start = start === undefined ? 0 : start
  end = end === undefined ? dew.length : end
  
  if (start > end) {
    return -1
  }

  const index = Math.floor((start + end)/ 2)
  const item = dew[index]
  
  for (let i = 0; i < dew.length; i++) {
    if (dew[i] == title) {
      return 'the book was found'
    }
    if (item < dew) {
      return dewDecSearch(dew, title, index + 1, end)
    } else if (item > dew) {
      return dewDecSearch(dew, title, start, index - 1)
    }
  }
}
````

Implement your algorithm to find a book whose Dewey and book title is provided.

```
console.log(dewDecSearch(['boat', 'float', 'boat', 'moat']))
```
