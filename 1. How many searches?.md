## 1. How many searches?
  - Given a sorted list `3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18` and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find `8`.
  
  
  ```
  function binarySearch(array, value, start, end) {
    var start = start === undefined ? 0 : start;
    var end = end === undefined ? array.length : end;

    if (start > end) {
        return -1;
    }

    const index = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
    const item = array[index];

    console.log(start, end);
    if (item == value) {
        return index;
    }
    else if (item < value) {
        return binarySearch(array, value, index + 1, end);
    }
    else if (item > value) {
        return binarySearch(array, value, start, index - 1);
    }
};
  ```  
  ```
let arr = [3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18]
  
indices    0  1  2  3   4   5   6   7   8   9  

```
```
console.log(binarySearch(arr, 8))
```

#### Output

###### First search output: ```0 10```
- Identify numbers checked in search of 8
- start at index 0, end at 10 because arr.length = 10
- first the function will check the middle of the array to the end `arr[5] => 12` (which is higher than 8, so the number we are looking for is not there)`8 < 12

###### Second search output: ```0 4```
- Check indices `[0]` and `[4]` for our number, but [4] which is `11` is too high and [0] which is `3` is still too low

###### Third search output: ```3 4```
- the function will now cut the first half of the array in half, and check `arr[3]`, which is our number `8` and `arr[4]` for our number but `arr[4]` or `11` is still too high

###### Forth search output: ```3```
- the final output tells us that the number we are looking for `8` is at an index of `[3]`
  
  - Given a sorted list `3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18` and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find `16`.
