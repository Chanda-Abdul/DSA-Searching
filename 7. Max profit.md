## 7. Max profit

The share price for a company over a week's trading is as follows: `[128, 97, 121, 123, 98, 97, 105]`. If you had to buy shares in the company on a particular day, and sell the shares on a subsequent day, write an algorithm to work out what the maximum profit you could make would be.

````
let arr = [128, 97, 121, 123, 98, 97, 105]

function maxProfit(array) {
  let max = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < array.length; j++) {
      if(array[j] - array[i] > max) {
        max = arr[j] - arr[i]
      }
    }
  }
  return max
}


console.log(maxProfit(arr))
